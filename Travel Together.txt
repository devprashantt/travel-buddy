## Future Development

The Travel Buddy app is an ongoing project with plans for continuous development and improvement. Here are some of the key features and enhancements that we envision for future releases:

1. **User Profiles and Social Integration:** Implement user profiles to allow travelers to create personalized accounts, manage their preferences, and connect with friends or fellow travelers. Integrate social media platforms to enable seamless sharing of travel experiences and recommendations.

2. **Smart Itinerary Suggestions:** Enhance the trip itinerary feature by incorporating machine learning algorithms and intelligent recommendations. The app can suggest personalized itineraries based on user preferences, past trips, and popular attractions, optimizing the travel experience.

3. **Integration with Travel APIs:** Integrate with external travel APIs to provide real-time information on flights, transportation options, weather conditions, and local events. This will enable users to make informed decisions and stay updated throughout their trip.

4. **Collaborative Trip Planning:** Expand the collaboration capabilities of the app by allowing trip members to contribute to the itinerary, vote on activities, and suggest new destinations. Implement real-time synchronization to ensure all members have the latest updates.

5. **Expenses Splitting and Payment Integration:** Enhance the expense tracking feature by enabling users to split costs among trip members and facilitate seamless payment options within the app. Integration with popular payment gateways can simplify expense management during the trip.

6. **Integration with Booking Platforms:** Enable users to directly book hotels, flights, and other travel-related services through integration with popular booking platforms. This will streamline the booking process and provide a seamless end-to-end travel experience.

7. **Offline Mode and Map Integration:** Develop an offline mode feature that allows users to access trip details, itineraries, and maps even when they don't have an internet connection. Integrate with map services to provide offline navigation and location-based suggestions.

These are just a few examples of the future development plans for the Travel Buddy app. We are committed to continuously improving the app and providing the best travel management solution for our users. Stay tuned for updates and new features in upcoming releases!
